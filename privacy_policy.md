**Privacy Policy for Nexaris**  
**Effective Date: September 11, 2025**  

## Introduction  
This Privacy Policy explains how Nexaris ("we," "our," or "the bot") collects, uses, and protects data when added to your Discord server. By adding Nexaris to your server, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the terms outlined in this policy. If you do not agree, please refrain from using the bot.  

## Data Collection  
Nexaris may collect the following data when operational:  
- User IDs and usernames for moderation purposes (e.g., bans, warnings).  
- Server IDs and configuration settings.  
- Message content (e.g., for filtering spam, inappropriate content, or other rule violations).  
- Timestamps and audit logs related to bot actions.  

This data is collected solely to facilitate the bot’s functionality and is not used for unrelated purposes.  

## Data Usage  
Collected data is used exclusively to:  
- Provide moderation, logging, and administrative features.  
- Ensure compliance with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines.  
- Improve bot performance and functionality.  
- Enforce server-specific rules and settings configured by administrators.  

## Data Storage  
- Data is stored securely on on-premise servers with restricted access.  
- Data is retained only as long as necessary for bot functionality or as required by law.  
- After removal from a server, associated data is scheduled for deletion within 30 days, unless legal obligations require longer retention.  

## Data Sharing  
- Nexaris does not sell, trade, or share data with third parties for commercial purposes.  
- Data may be disclosed to third parties only:  
  - As required by Discord’s Terms of Service.  
  - To comply with legal obligations, law enforcement requests, or regulatory requirements.  
  - To protect the rights, safety, or property of Nexaris, its users, or the public.  
- Server administrators may access logs and moderation history via bot commands, subject to their own server’s privacy practices.  

## User Rights  
- Users may request data deletion by contacting **contact@candl3d.com**.  
- Note that some data may be retained where necessary for legal compliance, dispute resolution, or enforcement of agreements.  
- Users are responsible for understanding and complying with their own server’s privacy policies and settings.  

## Security  
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. However, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. By using Nexaris, you acknowledge and accept this risk.  

## Limitation of Liability  
Nexaris and its developers are not liable for:  
- Any unauthorized access, data breaches, or misuse of data by third parties.  
- Inaccuracies in data provided by users or Discord.  
- Actions taken by server administrators or other users based on bot functionality.  
- Interruptions in service, data loss, or other operational issues beyond our control.  

## Changes to Policy  
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use of Nexaris constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. Users will be notified of significant changes via Discord or our support server.
